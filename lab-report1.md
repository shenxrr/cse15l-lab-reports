Visual Studio Code is successfully installed and you are all set!

Part 2: Connect to remote server
---------
After you have installed Visual Studio Code, We will try to remotely connect to server. Make sure you have installed git if you are on Windows.

First, we should open the terminal on VSCode using Ctrl or Command + \`, or use the Terminal â†’ New Terminal menu option. 
After setting up the password, we type `$ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` to terminal with zz replaced by your course account.

It will prompt you to enter your password. When you have entered correctly, you will see the messages:

This means you have successfully connected to remote server. 

Part 3: Trying some commands
---------
Now it's time to run some commands on your terminal.
`cd ~`

'cd'
> To Home directory
`ls`
> To list files in current directory
`ls -a`
> To list all files including hidden files
