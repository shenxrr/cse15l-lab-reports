The first one did not cause an error, but the second one is a failure inducing input
The corresponding output:

Part 3: Feedbacks
---------
I have learned a lot from this course. I did not know how to publish a page on github and edit it using .md. I found it a very useful skills to have. I also learned several terminal commands that I didi not know before. I also learned each component of an URL. In addition, I am more clear of how to connect to a remote server. Overall, this class is very rewarding.
