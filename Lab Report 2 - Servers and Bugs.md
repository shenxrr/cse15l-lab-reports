Here are the screenshots of using /add-message:
the method I used here is the else if statement. param[0] is the text I've entered, which is 'hello'

Here is the second message I added. I used the else if statement again. And this time, it created a new line, adding my second message to the new line.

The first one did not cause an error, but the second one is a failure inducing input
The corresponding output:

Part 3: Feedbacks
---------
I have learned a lot from this course. I did not know how to publish a page on github and edit it using .md. I found it a very useful skills to have. I also learned several terminal commands that I didi not know before. I also learned each component of an URL. In addition, I am more clear of how to connect to a remote server. Overall, this class is very rewarding.
